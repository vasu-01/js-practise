//let understand all the variables
var c =20;
if(true){
    let a = 2;      
    const b = 5;
    var c = 30;
}
// console.log(a);    //not print bcoz scope was till the closing curly braces '}'
// console.log(b);    //not print bcoz scope was till the closing curly braces
console.log(c);    //print the value even after scope and another problem is that output will be 30 instead of 20 



//similarly we do it with let
let newa = 20;
if(true){
    let newa = 2;
    console.log(newa); 
}
console.log(newa);   //output will be 2 first and then 20 not 2 like var becoz it follows global and local scope

//nested scope
function one(){
    const userName = "Vasu";

    function two(){
        const website = "youtube";
        console.log(userName);
        
    }
    console.log(website);  //return error becoz it's scope till two() function closing braces
    two();
}

// one();


if(true){
    const username = "vasu";
    if(username === "vasu"){
        const website = "youtube";
        console.log(username+website);
    }
    // console.log(website);   //return error same reason as of line 32
}
// console.log(username);   //return error becoz scope of username variable is inside if now outside if



//concept of hoisting (little intro of example)

console.log(addone(4));   //here it will give ouput as 5
function addone(num){
    return num+1;
}

console.log(addtwo(4));    //here it will give error that intilization not done while above was giving correct output and only difference is in declaring function in this we take function output in variable
const addtwo = function(num){
    return num +2;
}
